*********** Encapsulation  ***********
What are instance variables initialized to? 



What is the scope of instance variables (where can they be accessed)?



What are static variables and methods? 



*********** Inheritance (and encapsulation) ***********
Can a subclass access private instance variables of a superclass directly? 



Can a subclass access private instance variables of a superclass indirectly,
via a method? 


*********** Inheritance ****************
If A is a superclass of B, what methods can you call on A: A's methods, 
methods defined in both A and B, methods defined only in B? 



For each cases when you can call the method, which method will actually 
be called? 



What determines the most specific ("true") type of an object? 



************** Abstract classes *****************
How do you initialize a variable of an abstract class?



What methods can you call on a variable of an abstract class? 
What method will actually be called?
